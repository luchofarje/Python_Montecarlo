A new company recently founded believes that there's a potential business offering daily HD short videos (1 hour max) for two kind of populations "retired" and "young students".
The CEO needs to know if the number of servers and the amount of network bandwith to be implemented in the datacenter is enought to go live. He wants to assure a good service and how many customers will finalize to watch all the videos (max 5 per day) and are not going to jump off before one of the videos have finalized because of slowness or other "human" factors. The simulation process is going to be measured in time periods.
